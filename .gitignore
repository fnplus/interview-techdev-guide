#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.

# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However

# for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# Gemfile.lock
