**You are given an array A containing 2*N+2 positive numbers, out of which 2*N numbers exist in pairs whereas the other two number occur exactly once and are distinct. You need to find the other two numbers and print them in ascending order.**
 

    Input :
    The first line contains a value T, which denotes the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow .The first line of each test case contains a value N. The next line contains 2*N+2 space separated integers.

    Output :
    Print in a new line the two numbers in ascending order.

    Constraints :
    1<=T<=100
    1<=N<=10^6
    1<=A[i]<=5*10^8

    Example:
    Input :
    2
    2
    1 2 3 2 1 4
    1
    2 1 3 2
